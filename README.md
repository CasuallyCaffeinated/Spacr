#### *Spacr* is an application modeled on Flickr. It is an app that allows users to view pictures of space and its many wonders, including but not limited to: *stars, galaxies, nebulae, other miscellaneous interstellar phenomena such as quasars and dark matter, as well as planets from our own solar system*. 

#### Most of the images are accredited to the talented team over at NASA. The images were obtained via their website APOD, which may be found here: [APOD](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/aptree.html). 

#### Additionally, while some of the images are illustrations, most of the images are actual pictures. *Spacr* is written in the frontend with React and Redux, while the backend was built using Express.js.
